Build instructions
------------------

### Linux

Linux build has been successfully tested on FC18 with the following configure command :

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --prefix=<PREFIX> --disable-wsclient --disable-sandesha --disable-savan --enable-openssl --with-openssl --with-axis2=`pwd`/wsf_c/axis2c/include
    make
    make install
    ./build_codegen.sh <PREFIX>

This will create a WSF/C++ installation with Rampart and SSL enabled. Don't use `build.sh` since it will directly tinker various autoconf/automake scripts in your source tree, which is incredibly dirty and dangerous.

The configure scripts are a bit tricky, so other flag combinations can yield unexpected results.

To build the Axis2/C samples :

    cd wsf_c/axis2c/samples
    export AXIS2C_HOME=<PREFIX>
    ./configure --prefix=<PREFIX> --with-axis2
    make
    make install

### Windows MSYS/MinGW (32-bit and 64-bit)

Successfully tested on Windows 10 and msys2 with the following configure command :

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --disable-option-checking --prefix=<PREFIX> --enable-openssl --with-openssl --with-axis2=`pwd`/wsf_c/axis2c/include --enable-shared --disable-static --disable-sandesha --host=mingw32 --build=mingw32
    make
    make install

Even if the mingw compiler is 64-bit the host and build should still be mingw32.

### Windows

Just use `build.bat` and follow `README.INSTALL.WINDOWS`.
